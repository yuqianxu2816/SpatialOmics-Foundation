This project aims to develop a deep learning method for mass spectrometry representation based on self-supervised masked learning, utilizing serum mass spectrometry data from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cirrhosis. Unlike traditional supervised machine learning methods that rely on manual feature engineering and explicit labels (such as HCC vs cirrhosis), this project first learns general representations (spectral embeddings) of MS/MS spectra through self-supervision, and then applies this representation to downstream disease differentiation tasks, thereby exploring whether more robust and transferable representations can be obtained from small-sample, highly heterogeneous glycoproteomics data.
