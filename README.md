# SpatialOmics-Foundation

## Goal:

Single-cell and spatial MS, through MSI, mass cytometry, and nanoPOTS, advances T1D research from "average molecular changes" to "spatial and cellular-level molecular heterogeneity," enabling the first direct analysis of the islet microenvironment, immune cell infiltration pathways, and β-cell-specific molecular imbalances at the tissue scale.

## Input and Output

### Input

The pipeline supports three levels of input data:

- **`.raw`**  
  Raw LC-MS/MS files generated by the mass spectrometer.

- **`.mzML`**  
  Open-format files converted from `.raw`, used for spectrum extraction.

- **`.mgf`**  
  MS/MS spectra format used as the direct input for the self-supervised model.  
  Each `BEGIN IONS … END IONS` block represents one spectrum.

### Output

The pipeline produces:

- Processed spectra (MGF-based)
- Learned spectrum embeddings
- Sample-level embeddings
- **Downstream binary classification result**
  - HCC vs. cirrhosis
- Basic visualization (e.g., PCA / UMAP)


Note: for all the md documents except DDS.md, I used AI to format the documents such as organizing bullet points.
