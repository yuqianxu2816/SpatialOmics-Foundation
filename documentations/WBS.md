## Problem 1B

## Generate MGF Spectra as the First Basic Output

**Objective:**  
Produce MS/MS spectra in MGF format as the first basic computable output for downstream self-supervised learning.

**Tools / Libraries**
- ProteoWizard (`msconvert`)
  - Vendor-independent tool for converting `.raw` files to open formats
  - Used for `.raw` → `.mzML` conversion
- `pyteomics.mzml`
  - Read mzML files and iterate over spectra and filter MS2 scans (`ms level = 2`)
- `pyteomics.mgf`
  - Serialize MS/MS spectra into MGF format and write `BEGIN IONS … END IONS` blocks

---

### Step 1 — Convert raw LC-MS/MS files to mzML

**Task:**  
Convert vendor-specific `.raw` files into open-format `.mzML` files.

**Actions:**
- Install ProteoWizard
- Use `msconvert` to convert `.raw` → `.mzML`
- Retain full MS1 / MS2 information during conversion

**Deliverable:**  
- One or more valid `.mzML` files corresponding to original raw samples

**Completion criteria:**  
- `.mzML` files can be successfully opened and read by downstream tools (e.g., Pyteomics)

---

### Step 2 — Extract MS2 spectra from mzML

### add the libraries going to use!!! 

**Task:**  
Read `.mzML` files and extract MS/MS (MS2) spectra.

**Actions:**
- Use `pyteomics.mzml` to iterate through spectra
- Filter spectra by `ms level = 2`
- Extract:
  - m/z array
  - intensity array
  - precursor m/z (if available)

**Deliverable:**  
- In-memory representation of MS2 spectra as `(m/z, intensity)` arrays with optional precursor information

**Completion criteria:**  
- Each extracted spectrum contains valid m/z–intensity pairs
- The number of extracted MS2 spectra is greater than zero

---

### Step 3 — Write MS2 spectra to MGF format

**Task:**  
Serialize extracted MS2 spectra into MGF format for model input.

**Actions:**
- Format each spectrum as an MGF block:
  - `BEGIN IONS`
  - precursor information (PEPMASS)
  - `(m/z, intensity)` pairs
  - `END IONS`
- Write spectra using `pyteomics.mgf.write`

**Deliverable:**  
- A `.mgf` file where each `BEGIN IONS … END IONS` block represents one MS/MS spectrum

**Completion criteria:**  
- MGF file is successfully written to disk
- File can be parsed into spectrum objects
- At least one valid spectrum is present in the output MGF
