# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Overview

This project aims to develop a deep learning method for mass spectrometry representation based on self-supervised masked learning, utilizing serum mass spectrometry data from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cirrhosis. The learned representations are used to perform a binary disease classification task (HCC vs. cirrhosis) based on sample-level embeddings.

Unlike traditional supervised machine learning approaches that rely on manual feature engineering and explicit labels (e.g., HCC vs. cirrhosis), this project first learns general-purpose representations (spectral embeddings) of MS/MS spectra through self-supervision. These representations are then applied to downstream disease differentiation tasks, with the goal of exploring whether more robust and transferable representations can be obtained from small-sample, highly heterogeneous glycoproteomics data.

## 2. Intended Use and Use Cases

### 2.1 Intended Use

The software is intended for researchers working with LC-MS/MS proteomics or glycoproteomics data who wish to learn general-purpose spectral representations without relying on manual feature engineering or large labeled datasets.

### 2.2 Use Cases

Typical use cases include:

- Learning spectrum-level embeddings from MS/MS data using masked self-supervised learning
- Aggregating spectrum embeddings to represent biological samples
- Exploring whether learned embeddings capture disease-related structure (e.g., HCC vs. cirrhosis) through visualization or simple downstream models

## 3. Software Features

The software package provides the following core functionalities:

- Conversion and ingestion of mass spectrometry data in open formats (mzML and MGF)
- Extraction and preprocessing of MS/MS spectra as `(m/z, intensity)` pairs
- Self-supervised training of a masked reconstruction model to learn spectrum embeddings
- Generation of fixed-dimensional spectrum-level and sample-level embeddings
- Basic evaluation of learned embeddings using dimensionality reduction methods (e.g., PCA or UMAP)

### 3.1 Outputs

The output of the software includes:

- Processed MGF files
- Learned spectral embeddings
- Visualization plots for embedding evaluation

## 4. Data Access and Execution

### 4.1 Data Access

Input data are obtained from a public proteomics repository and provided as raw LC-MS/MS files. During development, a small representative subset of the data (e.g., one cirrhotic sample and one HCC sample) is used to enable rapid testing and iteration.

The software is designed to operate on these subsets during development and can later be applied to the full dataset for large-scale validation.

### 4.2 Execution Model

Users can run the provided Python scripts to perform:

- Data conversion
- Spectrum preprocessing
- Model training
- Embedding extraction

The software follows a modular design, allowing individual components (e.g., data conversion or embedding extraction) to be executed independently depending on the user’s needs.
