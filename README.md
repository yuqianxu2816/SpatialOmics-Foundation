# SpatialOmics-Foundation

Goal:

Single-cell and spatial MS, through MSI, mass cytometry, and nanoPOTS, advances T1D research from "average molecular changes" to "spatial and cellular-level molecular heterogeneity," enabling the first direct analysis of the islet microenvironment, immune cell infiltration pathways, and β-cell-specific molecular imbalances at the tissue scale.
