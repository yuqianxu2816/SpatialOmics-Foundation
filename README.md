# SpatialOmics-Foundation

## Biological Background (Spatial Omics Context)

This project is inspired by spatial omics studies of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where MALDI-based spatial glycan imaging reveals strong molecular heterogeneity within tumor tissue. Link to the paper which the project got inspirations: https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-024-00677-7 

Spatial omics provides the biological motivation by identifying disease-associated glycan patterns in tissue and serum.  

This project focuses on the computational side: learning general spectral representations from MS/MS data derived from these experiments using self-supervised learning.

## Biological Question

Can we use mass spectrometry data to learn meaningful molecular representations that help distinguish **hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)** from **cirrhosis**?

More specifically:

- Serum LC-MS/MS data contains thousands of MS/MS spectra reflecting underlying protein and glycoprotein states.
- Instead of relying on manually designed features, can we automatically learn representations from spectra themselves?
- Do these learned representations capture disease-related molecular patterns that support classification between HCC and cirrhosis?

This project explores a representation learning approach for **proteomics-related mass spectrometry data** inspired by spatial omics studies, aiming to understand whether self-supervised learning can reveal biologically meaningful structure from highly heterogeneous clinical samples.

## Overview

Mass spectrometry experiments generate a large number of spectra, each containing pairs of **m/z values and intensities**. Traditionally, downstream analysis depends heavily on manual feature engineering and labeled datasets, which can be limiting for small or heterogeneous biomedical datasets.

This project takes a different approach:

Instead of directly modeling spatial omics images, this project focuses on learning transferable representations from MS/MS spectra derived from spatial-omics-related workflows.

1. Convert raw LC-MS/MS data into standardized MS/MS spectra (MGF format)
2. Treat each spectrum as a learning object
3. Use **self-supervised masked learning** to train a model that reconstructs missing spectral information
4. Extract fixed-dimensional embeddings that summarize each spectrum
5. Aggregate spectrum embeddings into sample-level representations
6. Perform a simple downstream classification task (**HCC vs. cirrhosis**) to evaluate whether the learned embeddings capture disease-related structure

In short:

> Instead of manually defining features, we let the model learn how spectra are structured, and then test whether the learned representations are useful for disease differentiation.

## Input and Output

### Input

The pipeline supports three levels of input data:

- **`.raw`**  
  Raw LC-MS/MS files generated by the mass spectrometer.

- **`.mzML`**  
  Open-format files converted from `.raw`, used for spectrum extraction.

- **`.mgf`**  
  MS/MS spectra format used as the direct input for the self-supervised model.  
  Each `BEGIN IONS … END IONS` block represents one spectrum.


### Output

The pipeline produces:

- Processed spectra (MGF-based)
- Learned spectrum embeddings
- Sample-level embeddings
- **Downstream binary classification result**
  - HCC vs. cirrhosis
- Basic visualization (e.g., PCA / UMAP)

## Project Goal (Simple Summary)

- Learn general-purpose spectral embeddings from MS/MS data
- Reduce dependence on manual feature engineering
- Test whether learned embeddings separate HCC and cirrhosis
- Build a modular pipeline from raw MS data to downstream biological interpretation
